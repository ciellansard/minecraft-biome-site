            the
            buildings. The end is home to endermen, endermites and of course the enderdragon! The latter spawns in at
            the
            center of the main island above the final portal of the game.</h3>

            <p class="end_thing"> An END CRYSTAL is a special item that naturally forms at the top of the end pillars
              surrounding the portal. They are detrimental to defeating the enderdragon, seeing as with them it heals
              endlessly. They also be crafted by the player. Be careful however, because when the crystal is interacted
              with it explodes.</p>

            <p class="end_thing"> The ENDER DRAGON is the largest natural mob in minecraft and also the final boss of
              the game. It only spawns (naturally) in the end as it defends the portal home from the players. When
              fighting the dragon watch out for its acid attacks and for its wings, which can launch you quickly and
              fatally into the air.</p>

            <p class="end_thing"> The ENDERMAN is a threateningly tall mob that dislikes direct eye contact to the point
              of aggro-ing to whoever does. This mob can pick up blocks/items and place them down as they please. It is
              also hydrophobic and teleports very quickly to avoid or chase something.</p>

            <p class="end_thing"> An ENDERMITE is a suprise piranha like creature that may or may not appear whenver you
              throw an enderpearl. CAUTION: they bite.</p>

            <p class="end_thing"> The CHORUS FRUIT is a native end plant that allows whoever eats it to teleport 8
              blocks from their position, though the exact location is randomized and always a surprise. This is one of
              the only food items in minecraft that can be eaten even when the player's hunger is full.</p>

            <p class="end_thing"> The ELYTRA is one of the coolest perks of reaching the end. It is a one of a kind
              (genuinely there is only one) item, that allows the wearer to glide through the air. This item, paired
              with rockets, can allow you to soar endlessly in the sky.</p>

            <p class="end_thing"> A SHULKER is a horrible and very frustrating mob, that exists solely in the end and
              protects the end city ships. It attacks with little homing missiles out of its hard box like shell, and
              god forbid those things catch you because they cause you to float upwards with no control. On the positive
              side, these mobs, once killed, drop the materials for some of the most sought out items in the game. The
              shulker box! A chest that keeps its hold on whatever it has inside even when it breaks. Allowing the
              player to have a backpack-like thing in their pockets!

            <h1 class="left">THE STRONGHOLD</h1>
            <p class="left">A stronghold is a structure that holds the portal to the end. It will always spawn a minimum
              of 160 blocks away from the world origin. This place is very hard to get to purposefully. You need blaze
              powder and enderpearls to seek out its exact location.</p>
            <p class="left">Inside the stronghold, aside from the portal, there are a multitude of other rooms and
              mazes. Libraries and chests of loot, winding hallways and stairs. It is very easy to get lost in such a
              place.</p>

            <h1 class="left">END GATEWAY</h1>
            <p class="left">End gateways are interdimensional portals generated in the End, typically found on the
              outskirts of the islands, floating precariously above the void. These gateways can lead you from the main
              island to the farland end cities and vice-versa. All you need to do, for these to work, is to throw an
              enderpearl into its center.</p>

            <h1 class="left">END CITY</h1>
            <p class="left">End cities are anti-architect friendly structures that can be found at the other end of,
              well, the End. These odd formations of blocks that are actually buildings, are the home to shulker's and
              enderman. Above the end cities, you can find an end ship, which holds an elytra.</p>
