          <h3>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox adventure game developed by Mojang Studios where players can interact with a
            fully customizable three-dimensional world made of blocks and entities.</h3>

                </a>
                <p>Within Minecraft there are a large variety of forests throughout the world. These forests contain
                  diverse ecosystems, and are the most common biomes in the game. Many basic necessities are found
                  within these types of biomes needed to start off the game. Out of all biomes, these ones end to be
                  more on the friendly side compared to other biomes, with it only becoming dangerous at night time,
                  when it's dark out.

                </a>
                <p>Many important resources are hidden away deep within the caves. Throughout the Overworld, caves are
                  typically far more dangerous than the surface as there is typically no light, thus mobs are
                  constantly present. These biomes are full of mysterious structures for the players to explore.
                  Typically, these structures tend to be even more so dangerous than caves alone.

                  unique aquatic creatures, friendly and hostile alike. Oceans can be easy means to discover

                <p>One of the most dangerous places to be, the Nether is a scorching hot dimension in Minecraft. With
                  lava nearly everywhere, exploring this biome becomes incredibly risky, yet rewarding. Some of the
                  game's best materials reside deep within the Nether's many structures. Although this biome is
                  unbearably humid, it is still home to many diverse ecosystems full of life. Very cool.

                <p>The final frontier of Minecraft. This is where one of the most powerful adversaries resides. This
                  dimension is an archipelago of floating islands, surrounded by a bottomless void. Being the last and
                  most dangerous dimension, it is incredibly difficult to explore. However the materials gained from
                  doing so are incredibly valuable. Although at that late point in the game, the value of such tools is
                  questionable, it's still impressive.
